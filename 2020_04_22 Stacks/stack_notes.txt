Stacks: a very useful data structure.

LIFO: Last In, First Out

Can be used to reverse order of data:

13, 16, 45, 56 -> 56, 45, 16, 13

we can uses a stack to reverse these.


Primary operations - all of these are O(1):

push -> inserts data on the top of the stack

pop -> removes data from the top of the stack

peek -> takes a look at the value at the top of the stack without removing it

Secondary operations:

isEmpty -> returns true if stack empty, or false if there are items on stack

clear -> clears all items off stack

toString -> displays all items on the stack from top to bottom
